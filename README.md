# bookShelf_app
The Book Shelf app is a website that I created to complete a Submission that was given to the "Learning Front - End for Beginners" class course.  On this website, you can insert books, delete books, move unread books into the list of books that have been read. Then, you can also move books that have been read to the list of unread books. Finally, there is a book search feature that you can use to save time searching for books, just by typing the title, the book you are looking for will appear.
